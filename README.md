 # Titanic-Survivor-Data-Analysis

In this project, I analyzed titanic dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

Tasks to achieve from this project:
## After completing the project, you will:

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process

Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions

Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use

Have practice communicating the results of your analysis

Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up your data analysis code

Be familiar with Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently

Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings


## Why is this Important to my Career?

This project will show off a variety of data analysis skills, as well as showing potential employers that you know how to go through the entire data analysis process.
